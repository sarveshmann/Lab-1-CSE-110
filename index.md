# Hi! I am Sarvesh Mann.
## About me
I am a third year **computer science student** at [UC San Diego](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_San_Diego). I do not consider myself to be an expert programmer but rather a learning programmer because I think programming requires constant learning and exploration of new things. I decided to go with computer science because I love computers. Over the past few years of studying computer science, I have gained some [experience and skills](#soft-skills), which I have added below as well. They've always fascinated me ever since I was a child. I remember my first ever computer which had a boxy display and all off-white color (apparently called a "[*Beige Box*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beige_box)"). Regardless of its looks, I was content with the wonderful possibilities of that box. I enjoyed and still enjoy the feeling of installing new games and playing them, surfing the internet, and exploring the vast *digital realm*.

When I am not on my computer, you can find me playing with my pets, at a beach, cooking or trying new foods, or maybe all together. I have a pet cat named Misa, you can see her below, and two dogs ([you can see them here](./mydogs.jpeg)), Boondi ([Pomeranian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomeranian_dog)) and Thunder ([Pitbull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit_bull)).

## My experience and skills:
> **Experience**: For the most part, I have only done programming related to my courses at my community college, Norco College, and UCSD. These courses, such as **CSE 8A, 12, 15L, 30, and 100** at UCSD, have allowed me to be familiar with some common programming languages and earn skills related to programming. I have also learned about some fundamental algorithms and data structures from courses like **CSE 20, 21, 30, 100 and 101** at UCSD as well. Other than programming courses, I have also earned some soft-skills and data science experience from courses like **ENG 100D, MGT 18, MGT 172, and COGS 108** at UCSD. Below are two lists describing my **soft** and **technical skills**.

### Skills:
* **Soft skills**:
    1. Working in teams both big and small
    2. Communication and collaboration
    3. Analytic thinking and problem solving
    4. Planning and scheduling
    5. Presenting and reporting progress to stakeholders

* **Technical skills**:
    1. Familiarity with Java, C, C++, Python
    2. Data structures
    3. Figma
    4. Basic knowledge about Github and Jupyter Notebook
    5. Basic knowledge about HTML, Latex, and Markdown
