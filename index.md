# Hi! I am Sarvesh Mann.
## About me
I am a third year computer science student at [UC San Diego](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_San_Diego). I do not consider myself to be an expert programmer but rather a learning programmer because I think programming requires constant learning and exploration of new things. I decided to go with computer science because I love computers. They've always fascinated me ever since I was a child. I remember my first ever computer which had a boxy display and all off-white color (apparently called a "[Beige Box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beige_box)"). Regardless of its looks, I was content with the wonderful possibilities of that box. I enjoyed and still enjoy the feeling of installing new games and playing them, surfing the internet, and exploring the vast digital realm.

When I am not on my computer, you can find me playing with my pets, at a beach, cooking or trying new foods, or maybe all together. I have a pet cat named Misa, you can see her below, and two dogs, Boondi ([Pomeranian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomeranian_dog)) and Thunder ([Pitbull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit_bull)).

## My experience and skills:
> For the most part, I have only done programming related to my courses at my community college, Norco College, and UCSD. These courses, such as CSE 8A, 12, 15L, 30, and 100 at UCSD, have allowed me to be familiar with some common programming languages and earn skills related to programming. I have also learned about some fundamental algorithms and data structures from courses like CSE 20, 21, 30, 100 and 101 at UCSD as well. Other than programming courses, I have also earned some soft-skills and data science experience from courses like ENG 100D, MGT 18, MGT 172, and COGS 108 at UCSD. Below are two lists describing my soft and technical skills.

### Soft skills:
* Working in teams both big and small
* Communication and collaboration
* Analytic thinking and problem solving
* Planning and scheduling
* Presenting and reporting progress to stakeholders

### Technical skills:
* Familiarity with Java, C, C++, Python
* Data structures
* Figma
* Basic knowledge about Github and Jupyter Notebook
* Basic knowledge about HTML, Latex, and Markdown
